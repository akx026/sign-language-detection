# 🧏‍♂️ Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project detects hand gestures and translates them into sign language characters (A-Z, 0-9) using **OpenCV**, **Mediapipe**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**. It aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities.
